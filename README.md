# My Recipe Box - React
This is a full-stack React app that is a front end for an API I built a month ago. The purpose of the app is to enable users to create an account to create and save their favourite recipes. They will also be able to search through other people's recipes and save them.

The objective of this project was to have authentication and authorization implemented in it, and to communicate with some API routes on my server. 

Based on the scope of the project and time permitted to complete it, I focued on three MVPs:
1) for a User to be able to sign up and log in
2) For a User to be able to see all the created recipes on the home page
4) For a User to create a recipe

In addition, I added a user profile page, conditional photo rendering, conditional recipe rendering, adn all of the styling and layout.
